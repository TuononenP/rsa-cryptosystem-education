Methods to be implemented:

DONE -Method that tests if p and q are equal

DONE -Create a prime generator (~100% sure the number is a prime)


-Another method to determine d, check 5) from handout

	d = (x*phi(n)+1)/e    (Test which x makes the equation to be integer, and once you find it, the equation = d)

-Padding schemes - 3 different types (see the handout)

-Use multiple CPU cores when generating p and q primes.
