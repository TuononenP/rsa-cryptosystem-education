Methods to be implemented:

DONE public boolean checkUniformity(BigInteger p, BigInteger q)

DONE Create a prime number (100% sure the number is a prime)


  another method to determine d, check 5) from handout

	d = (x*phi(n)+1)/e    (Test which x makes the equation to be integer, and once you find it, the equation = d)

Padding schemes - 3 different types (see the handout)
