Info:
This software is a part of OOP course work at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
The RSA encryption/decryption software is aimed for educational use to teach cryptography.

Short description:
RSA cryptosystem for educational use to teach and learn cryptography. Every step executed
by the cryptosystem is visible (printed lines). User can select custom primes to create keys
and then choose from three padding schemes to encrypt messages. Encryption steps are then
printed on the screen and the user can learn how the encryption is done mathematically. User
can even test if his/her encryption with pen and paper is correctly done. Great for teachers
who teach cryptography and students desiring to learn.
