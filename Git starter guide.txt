Git starter guide by TuononenP

1. Install Git

2. Get Github account

3. Tell git your user name and email address from Github account
   (Write the following codes to Git bash, replace name and email address)
   git config --global user.name "example"
   git config --global user.email example@gmail.com

4. Create your public/private key pair (use same email you typed earlier)
   ssh-keygen -C “name@email.com” -t rsa   (if you see question marks around email, they should be quatation marks)

5. Get a full clone of all the files in repository
   (in Vista default saving location is C:\Users\username\rsa-cryptosystem-education):
   git clone git://github.com/TuononenP/rsa-cryptosystem-education.git

6. Get the newest files from server to your local computer:
   git pull origin branch_name

7. Make changes to the files on your computer

8. Update server's files with your modifications
   cd to the right directory with bash (e.g. cd rsa-cryptosystem-education)
   git add filename/folder     (tells git which file you want to send to server)
   git commit -m 'Explain what you changed'	(comment changes)     
   (the next line actually applies the changes to the server)
   git push git@github.com:TuononenP/rsa-cryptosystem-education.git  (path needed only first time)


To update local branch with server's branch:
   git pull origin branch_name	(if first time pulling)
   git pull

To create experiment branch:
   cd rsa-cryptosystem-education
   git branch experiment
   git pull origin experiment

To change branch:
   git checkout branch_name

To check which branch you are editing:
   git branch
